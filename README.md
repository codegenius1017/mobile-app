# JSConfUY

In this workshop we are going to go through the process of building a hybrid mobile app using Ionic Framework.
This repo will serve as a guide and in this README.md you can find all the steps and instructions needed to build the app.

* [Here](http://startapplabs.github.io/starting-with-ionic/#/) you can find the slides of the presentation at the JSConfUY 2015
* [Here](https://jsconfuy2015.herokuapp.com/) you can find a hosted version of the app we are going to build
* You can also deploy your own copy of the app using this button: [![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/startapplabs/jsconfuy/tree/master)
* You can download the app from Apple App Store [here]()
* You can download the app from Google Play [here]()
* *[If the app isn't yet approved]* This is the ID (`ID`) of the JSConfUY app on [Ionic View](). If you want to test the app in your device you can follow [these steps]() and get the app through Ionic View
* *[If the app isn't yet approved]* And you are an Android user, you can download the `.apk` [here]()

**Notice:**
* This is not a mobile web, after compiled you will get a native app that uses web technologies (JS, CSS, HTML). The hosted example is just for you to see how the app is going to be, but remember that what you are going to see in the hosted version is a pre build example of the app, all the interactions with native mobile APIs (inAppBrowser, Social Share, etc) won't be available.
* Ionic View is ment to provide an easy way to share and try mobile apps built with Ionic. That said, there are some cordova plugins that are not yet integrated in Ionic View. That may cause that some functionalities won't work if you are trying the app on Ionic View.
* For a better experience we recommend you to download the app from the App Store or Google Play or to download the `.apk` if you are an Android user.
